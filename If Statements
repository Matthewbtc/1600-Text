Whats nice about the if statements is that they are pretty similar to that of the same name in Javascript.
How they work are, if something is declared in a if statement it will only work IF the if condition is
not, restraining it from functioning. For example if I wanted code to run if the player's health was full
it would run when, and only when the characters health is full. However, its not only right or wrong 
statements. If the situation were if the characters health is at >= 50% then the code whould run when the 
character's health is anywhere between 50% or 100%. Else statements add a new dimention, they can make an
effect for if the if statement is not true.
