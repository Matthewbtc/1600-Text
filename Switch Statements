A switch is a great and unique way to set up large amounts of sercomstances while probably
being the most efficient and the easiest way to navigate thoughout a script. In stead of 
having many if/else statements running throuout your code you can set up a switch statement
that will guide the user throghout the code. How I see switches is like a power strip with
multiple switches (like a light switch), each time a statement is true, or is completes you
turn on the switch and the power runs through until it hits another off switch. At the end 
of the switch there should be a default, this is basically the else in a if/else statement.
