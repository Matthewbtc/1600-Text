Arrays are a way of storing data of the same kind together. When you make an array you must 
clearify how many items, or elements are tored inside of it. One way to look at it is, you 
title your array and give it a number, lets say 4, within that array you will have 4 
different elements all calling back to the array name. However, what seperates them is the 
place they are at, or the number they hold (0-3). Arrays can also be run by stating a single 
line of code. How arrays are mainly run are by the location, and number of elements.
