Enumerations, or enum's are a little wierd to understand, or at least for some at first. They 
are an alternative way to right statements similar to arrays. And not only do they function 
similarly to arrays, but they actually form comand prompts unlike arrays. What this means is
that you can form a set of enums that will be permanatly be imbeded within the classes. This 
can save time, and helps with consistency when sharing larger projects with numerous amounts
of people.
