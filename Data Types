All varieables have some kind of datatype wheather it be a value type or a refference type. Value types
are known as integers, floats, booleans, characters, or strucks. Strucks are datatypes that contain more 
then one or more variables. Transform classes and GameObject classes are the main forms of refference 
types. The main difference between the two are values actually do contain some kind of value, and if it
changes then the only that one value changes. While a refference depends on the memory stored, so if 
changed anything with that memory storage will be effected.
