So what it seems like is that classes (how they put it, and how I kind of like seeing it as) 
are containers that you fill with in formation. You can dump in these containers anything you want the containers
to be. Sort of the base or stamp that you shape so that you can make coppied variations off of it.


Scopes seem to be not objects or settings, but more determained by where an object or setting is within the code.
Its a location more like, a place where code sits reletive to the big picture.

ACCESS MODIFIERS:
I finally seem to get these, It would seem that these are the blinds (window) of the program. When you leave the
blinds open, you are letting other things outside the class see into it. Much like letting your neighborhood see
into your home, show off your new furnature. However, when your home is a mess... you shut the blinds, or make the
class private so it cannot be read or seen.
